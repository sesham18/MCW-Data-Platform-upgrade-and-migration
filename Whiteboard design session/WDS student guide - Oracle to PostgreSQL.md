# Data Platform upgrade and migration whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract

In this whiteboard design session, you work with a group to design a proof of concept (POC) for conducting a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You evaluate the dependent applications and reports that need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. Also, you review ways to help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency, as well as explore ways to migrate from an old version of SQL Server to the latest version and consider the impact of migrating from on-premises to the cloud.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a database migration plan and implementation.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer’s needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer.

2. Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

World Wide Importers (WWI) has experienced massive growth over the last few years. That growth has resulted in a tremendous influx of new data they need to maintain their business. This data has become increasingly expensive to store in an Oracle relational database management system (RDBMS). Oracle upgrades are tedious and expensive projects. Business stakeholders have tired of the process and have requested a proof of concept (POC) for replacing Oracle with Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Azure Database for PostgreSQL brings many benefits to the table, including excellent performance, support for high-availability, and enterprise security features like AD support.

WWI is investigating ways to improve the performance of their transactional databases without incurring expensive new license fees. They're also concerned with keeping their transactional system available and online for their store. They've noticed that Oracle has been slowing down as their growth has doubled. They realize that they would need to invest in new hardware to achieve this on-premises and, as a result, are looking at this as more of a migration to a new system.

WWI has several external and internal applications that need to migrate with the database. The database is used by an online store application, written in ASP.NET MVC. They also have internal applications that manage their product catalog, written in Oracle Forms. In addition, they have many reports to aid in forecasting, sales reporting, and inventory maintenance. Those reports are a mixture of Power BI, Excel, and Oracle Forms, and hit the Oracle OLTP database directly.

WWI also uses this database to interact with vendors. Several of their vendors require real-time access to their sales data through an API so they can draw warranty information on the date of sale. They do this through a Representational State Transfer (REST) service that is maintained by WWI.

Before WWI invests in this project, they want a proof of concept that encompasses these touchpoints and proves that it can be successful.

WWI also has a new requirement. They have an existing web service that interacts with a vendor to get the latest certifications of that vendor's products. The JSON parser sometimes fails, and they can't figure out why. They'd like to store the original, unparsed JSON in a table for troubleshooting purposes. They would like to be able to query the JSON data by date or other identifying pieces of the JSON that might be available for troubleshooting and are interested in learning more about the best way to do that.

Also, they had a significant outage last year because one of their audit tables ran out of space. They had to wait many hours to resolve the issue while their IT department scrambled to make space on an already overloaded Storage Area Network (SAN). They would like a full briefing on how to monitor that situation, so it doesn't happen again, and possible remedies if it does happen again. They would also like high availability to be built into the project plan and are wondering what additional fees that would incur.

Kathleen Sloan, the CIO of WWI, is looking to decrease their software license fees, take advantage of a modern data warehouse, and provide a strong vision of availability for the future that can handle their momentous growth. She is sold on PostgreSQL, but her Oracle DBAs keep telling her that migration to PostgreSQL is simply impossible. They cite that they have never done it before. They say it's hard to find tools that make it possible. The Oracle DBAs say that PostgreSQL is not as high performing as Oracle, does not have great high availability like Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), and doesn't have a replacement for Oracle Forms. She's tired of hearing "no" whenever the topic is brought up and would love to prove them wrong. She is also exploring the cloud and is wondering if she can make a direct migration to a cloud database or if she must stay on-premises because of her requirements. She has seen PostgreSQL make tremendous gains in features over the last several versions, particularly in business intelligence.

### Customer needs

1. Wants to migrate an existing Oracle database to PostgreSQL on-premises, PostgreSQL in an Azure VM, or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

2. Needs to know what's involved in migrating the external sales application to PostgreSQL.

3. Wants a better understanding of what to do with the internal Oracle Forms application.

4. Has multiple touchpoints with external vendors and wants to know what needs to change with those web services.

5. Need web-based visualizations on sales and forecasting, and a plan on how to upgrade their existing reporting infrastructure.

6. Have a new requirement on what to do with JSON data.

7. They experienced an outage last year and are hyper concerned with not repeating that experience. The audit table filled up, and they ran out of disk space. They'd like to know what would have happened if Azure Database for PostgreSQL experienced the same issue and what your solution would be.

8. As a follow-up, they'd also like to know how to answer the Oracle DBA's allegation that Azure Database for PostgreSQL doesn't have an answer for Oracle RAC.

### Customer objections

1. Do we need to upgrade to on-premises PostgreSQL first or go can we go straight to Azure?

2. Can we have two proofs-of-concept that demonstrate both migrations?

3. Do we need to rewrite all our applications for Azure Database for PostgreSQL?

4. Do we need to rewrite all our reports for Azure Database for PostgreSQL?

5. Will our security migrate over from Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL? How do we handle security in the new database?

6. Do we need to invest in a JSON storage system for the JSON data we're storing from our vendor's web service?

7. What will we do if our audit logs fill up again? Will Azure Database for PostgreSQL crash the same way Oracle did?

8. If we take advantage of new features, will our license costs keep ratcheting up and up? Will we have a dependable way of budgeting for this project?

9. Are there any Oracle features required by WWI for which Azure Database for PostgreSQL has no equivalent?

10. Do we need to tell all our vendors that we're changing databases, so their integrations work?

11. What will happen with Power BI?

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions, and list the answers on a flip chart:

1. Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision-makers?

2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

*High-level architecture*

1. Without getting into the details (they are addressed in the following sections), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for data loading, data preparation, storage, high availability, application migration, and reporting. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.

2. What should be included in the POC?

3. How will PostgreSQL save them on licensing costs?

*Schema and data movement*

1. How would you recommend that WWI move their data and schema into PostgreSQL? What services would you suggest and what are the specific steps they would need to take to prepare the data, to transfer the data, and where would the loaded data land?

2. Update your diagram with the data loading process with the steps you identified.

*Application changes*

1. What product would you recommend to WWI to migrate their storefront MVC application to the new PostgreSQL database?

2. How would you migrate the Oracle Forms applications? How would you define success? Are there any technologies the customer needs to know?

3. What will you do about the vendor touchpoints? How will you recommend they store the JSON data?

*Reporting*

1. How can they discover which reports and Excel spreadsheets hitting the Oracle database need to be upgraded? What's a proper upgrade path?

*High Availability and Audit Table*

1. If our solution were PostgreSQL, what could WWI have done with the audit table when it filled up?

2. What are the PostgreSQL options for high availability?

*Azure Database for PostgreSQL POC*

1. Should they move to on-premises first?

2. Is there any benefit to going straight to Microsoft Azure? Does Azure SQL Database take care of all their requirements?

3. Are there any questions we need to answer before we can begin a POC directly to Microsoft Azure?

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table:

1. Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2. Identify the benefits of your solution.

3. Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1. Pair with another table.

2. One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3. The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4. The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5. The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6. The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

7. Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2-6.

## Wrap-up

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.
